A clean and responsive QR Code Generator Web Application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and focuses on simplicity, fast performance, and user-friendly design.This tool allows users to instantly generate QR codes from text, links, or any custom input — making data sharing fast and effortless.
This project demonstrates my ability to build practical frontend applications using real-world web technologies


Features:

*  Instant QR generation without page reload
*  Mobile-friendly responsive interface
*  Download generated QR as image
*  Simple and user-focused UI design
